                <p>This site and the notes contained in this site were written with the intent of providing students and instructors with a free set of notes that they could use for their classes. The original impetus for this site was the skyrocketing price of textbooks. So, when I set up this site I had hoped that those using the site would adhere to the spirit with which I had created the site.

                        <br /><br /> Unfortunately, I have found that there are always those that will abuse anything if they think they can get away with it and/or for a quick bit of cash. Within the first year of setting this site up I have found people hosting pages, or portions of pages, and/or the pdf downloads from this site on their web server without any acknowledgement of where they originated and in some instances had claimed to have actually authored the material.
                        
                        <br /><br /> So, I find that I have no choice but to set up these terms and conditions for the use of this site and to restrict in some ways the usage of the material contained in this site. These terms and conditions are not intended to harm anyone in any way. They are here so I can protect my rights and work from those that would abuse it and/or use it contrary to the use for which it was intended.
